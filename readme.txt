== Frequently Asked Questions ==
How does TweetShare Work?
TweetShare lets you create easy-to-tweet microcontent from within the blog fo ryour readers to share on Twitter. 

What features does TweetShare offer?
You can create two different types of tweetable quotes:
- Tweetbox - where your micro-content will be displayed seperatly from the regular text.
- Inline Tweet - where your text will flow with your content, but will be highlighted with the color of your choice.

Can I customize the tweetable quote box?
Yes, you change the text, background and button color using the color picker provided.

Do I require any programming knowledge to customize it?
No, this is a very easy to use tool and does not require any edits in the code.

How can I enable url shortening?
Shortening URL is to easy with Tweetshare. Just goto TweetShare setting and click on enable short url option.

How can I select different theme options?
Just goto TweetShare setting and select any new theme from the select box and click save settings. 

How can I add my tweetable quote in the post?
Adding a tweetable quote is very easy with TweetShare. You can either use the shortcode, [tweetshare tweet="Your tweetable quote goes here"] and add your quotes within the quoted marks or use the Tweetshare icon from the visual editor, select the "Tweetbox" option and type in your text there.

Is there any character limit to the content that I can tweet?
Yes, the default length of the tweetable quote box is 117. Here is the reason for that limit:
-Twitter allows tweets only upto a length of 140 character.
- by default Twitter uses its own URL shortener which is displayed as t.co and the length of the URL is automatically truncated to 23 characters.
- This leaves us with 140-23 = 117, is what we are left with.

Do not worry if your tweet goes over that. We just truncate the text (the characters that go over the Twitter's default limit so that it wont interfere your user experience.
